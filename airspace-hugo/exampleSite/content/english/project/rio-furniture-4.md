## Organic Cosmetics
After growing our own Immortelle plantations and securing the steam distillery, we decided to close
the production cycle with the organic Immortelle cosmetics. After thorough testing over
several months during which we developed a new cosmetic line, we came up with the certification of 15
cosmetic products and 9 essential oils for sale on the EU market. One of the results of the project
was the entry of cosmetic products in the CPNP - EU register of cosmetic products.

We consider starting the production of top quality cosmetics with a high percentage of active
substance - Immortelle essential oil, an activity that will make the business of growing and distilling
Immortelle sustainable in the long run, making our company a relevant producer of natural
cosmetics.
