## Distillation

In order to complete the process of growing Immortelle on our plantations, we
ordered a custom steam distillery to meet our needs. The equipment is permanently
placed on a large truck trailer and is always ready to work at any location in Croatia,
as close as possible to the areas from which we process medicinal herbs. For now,
we plan to distil chamomile and lemon balm in Slavonia, and immortelle, laurel and
lavender in Dalmatia. With a capacity of 4,000 L, the mobile distillery is able to
process approximately 800 kg of the green plant mass in a cycle.

Our equipment operates by the method of steam distillation in which steam passes
through the plant mass and carries valuable fragrant substances. From the harvest of
the plant to the processing into essential oil, it never takes longer than six hours. The
steam distillery always works with low pressures and temperatures to produce
essential oils of the highest quality. It is also equipped for the extraction and
processing of hydrolates, as we are immediately able to perform double sterile
filtration. In full production of our own areas, we can annually produce approximately
90 kg of immortelle essential oil and several thousand liters of hydrolate. During the
immortelle harvesting season, the distillery can process roughly 450 t of immortelle
green mass. We are always open for cooperation and processing of medicinal herbs
from other plantations, with possible various arrangements.
