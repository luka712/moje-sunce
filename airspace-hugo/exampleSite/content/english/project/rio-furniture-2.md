## Organic Medicinal Herbs

In the area of Bilice in Å ibenik - Knin County, our company planted approximately 260,000
seedlings of the plant Helicrysum italicum, also known as Immortelle. Immortelle was planted on a
karst field where nothing was ever grown and which remaind free from pollution. Through a demanding process, we
obtained clean and intact tracts of land from a neglected land area, which is ready for the cultivation of Immortelle and
other medicinal plants. Our partners developed seedlings from the seeds of the native Croatian
species, which we returned to their original habitats and arranged for cultivation. Without a
trace of artificial fertilizers and herbicides since planting, our plantation has an ecological certificate
of cultivation.

Immortelle (lat. Helichrysum italicum) possesses almost miraculous properties in skin care because it affects
all skin types with an emphasis on the regeneration of damaged and mature skin prone to wrinkles. It
is well known for its extremely strong antioxidant effect.

Immortelle as an active substance in creams and other cosmetic products stimulates skin cell
renewal, reduces wrinkles and fine lines, protects the skin from free radicals, stimulates collagen
production, reduces scarring and skin discoloration, has anti-inflammatory effects and promotes
healing.

As with all plants, its scent comes from its essential oil. It has a very complex composition - it
contains compounds such as nerol, neryl acetate and a group of compounds - italidions, which are
almost non-existent in other types of plants.
