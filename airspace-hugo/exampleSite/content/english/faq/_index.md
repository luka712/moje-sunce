#### 1. WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN ESSENTIAL OIL?

There are recognized quality standards throughout the world that reputable companies follow. This
includes GC/MS testing.

GC/MS testing (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry) reveals important details about the
essential oil quality, including:

  *  __what specifically is in the oil__, including different types of oils (for example, some brands will
    use a small amount of a high-quality essential oil and combine it with a lower quality essential
    oil to reduce the cost. This also reduces the benefits though!) GCMS testing will allow you to
    see exactly what’s in each bottle.
  *  __whether there are any additives or adulterations__
  *  __the beneficial compounds and percentages of each__ component in the oil

If you’re interested in the chemistry of essential oils, there are websites that list the recommended
percentages of the different natural compounds in each essential oil and you can compare those to
the oils you are considering buying.

As a reputable company **the quality and transparency are a priority to us so all of our analysis and certificates are published on the page.**

&nbsp;
#### 2. CAN I GET A SAMPLE OF YOUR ESSENTIAL OILS?

Yes! If you’ve seen the analysis but still want to test the oils for yourself we provide free oil
samples that can be shipped worldwide.

&nbsp;
#### 3. CAN I VISIT YOU AND SEE THE PROCESS?

Yes! We invite everyone who is interested to come and visit us on our distillery and see the
whole process for themselves. As the distillery is mobile, we tend to move it closer to the
fields we are currently distilling to provide the highest quality oil. Please contact us
beforehand to arrange time and location.

&nbsp;
#### 4. ARE YOUR OILS ECOLOGICAL?

Yes! All of our crops are ecological which is continuously tested every year. That means we
don’t use pesticides or any sorts of additives which can be seen in our analysis and
certificates.

&nbsp;
#### 5. DO YOU ONLY DO WHOLESALE?

At the moment we do not offer essential oil in small bottles with our own branding. Our oil is
intended for the bulk buyers such as resellers or aromatherapists who need larger quantities
of oil for their businesses. However, we can also provide you with smaller amounts, feel free
to ask.
