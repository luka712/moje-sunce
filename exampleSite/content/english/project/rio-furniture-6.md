## Ultrasonic Extraction

Our future should be green and clean, as well as very advanced and modern. With
the help of EU funds and in cooperation with The Faculty of Food Technology and
Biotechnology at the University of Zagreb, we are nearing the end of the project
evaluation within the EU program Competitiveness and Cohesion - Research,
Technological Development and Innovation. Our project idea - “The development of
an innovative production process for the production of CBD oil“ has passed
inspections and evaluations and we hope to sign a contract soon.

In the last few years, CBD oil has become the product of greatest demand in the EU
with the announcements of large growth in consumption. The production is very
technologically complex, because most of the process takes place either under
enormous pressures or in a vacuum. The equipment is complex and expensive, and
production requires large investments from the very beginning.

Within the proposed three years of laboratory and industrial research, we will strive to
obtain four groups of products from industrial hemp flowers, along with several
extracts from grape seeds and vegetables such as garlic and parsley. The method
used is called ultrasonic extraction and vacuum distillation and is completely
environmentally friendly. In addition to CBD oils, we plan to produce organic cold-
pressed oils and proteins as a dietary supplement.
