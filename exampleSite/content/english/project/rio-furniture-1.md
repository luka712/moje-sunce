## Solar Power Plants

Our company built and owns 9 solar power plants on the roofs of primary schools in Osijek-Baranja
County with a total power of approximately 270 kW. A contract on the sale of electricity from
renewable sources was signed with HROTE – Croatian Energy Market Operator, and lasts until the
2028. Elementary schools generate funds from roof rental income each year, while our company
takes care of the roofs and provides domestic hot water from the solar collectors.

We remain one of the few entrepreneurs in Croatia who have installed photovoltaic power plants as
renewable energy sources on public buildings. We believe it to be a good and sustainable
combination for both investors and users of facilities.
