## Organic Almond Orchard

In 2021, our company will start the project of planting 11 hectares of almond orchards near the town
of Benkovac. The plan is to plant approximately 2,500 almond trees in the fall of that year, with the
goal of reaching the full fruition in four years. Production will be completely organic, without
herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers. Later on, we plan to develop the production of several new
products from the almond core and leaves â€“ chocolate almond sweets and almond oil for cosmetics.

In a full yield we expect 20 tons of almond kernels, which should mainly end up as a raw material for
further processing. If we implement orchard irrigation and pollination by bees, the yield can increase
up to 40 %.
