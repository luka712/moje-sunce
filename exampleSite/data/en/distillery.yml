  title : "The art of steam distillation"
  content :  "Steam distillation is by far the most popular method used to extract and isolate essential oils from
              plants for use in natural products. This happens when steam vaporizes the plant materials volatile
              compounds, which eventually go through a condensation and collection process.
              \n\n
              Our distillery is mobile which means it is permanently placed on the specialised trailer. That gives us
              the opportunity to easily transport it to so we can be close to the field we are distilling. It has a joint
              capacity of 4000 L and can process approximately 800-1000 kg of fresh herb per cycle."

    - content: "The very important step before starting any distillation is to heat the whole system. That
                means that the steam generator has to run on an empty system to steam both the
                containers and the condensers."

      no : 2
    - content: "Through an inlet, steam is injected through the plant material containing the desired oils,
                releasing the plant's aromatic molecules and turning them into vapor."
      no : 3
    - content: "The vaporized plant compounds travel to the condensation flask, also known as the
                condenser.  Here, two separate pipes make it possible for hot water to exit and for cold
                water to enter the condenser.  This makes the vapor cool back to liquid form."
      no : 4
    - content: "Finally, the aromatic liquid collects in the separator and because oil and water don't mix, the
                essential oil floats to the top of the ware. From here it is siphoned off. What we have left on
                the bottom is called hydrolate, also known as ‘flower water’ which is commonly used in
                cosmetics and toiletries."

    - content: "After every shift or in between different herbs, containers, condensers and separators are
                thoroughly steamed and cleaned for 2 hours to avoid oxidation and contamination of the left
